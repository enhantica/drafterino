# Drafterino

Turn labeled pull requests into draft releases and version bumps.

Drafterino is a lightweight GitHub Action that automatically generates draft 
release notes and determines the next version number â€” all based on merged 
pull requests and their labels. It:

- Detects merged pull requests since the last release
- Groups them into release note sections based on labels
- Computes the next version using SemVer (`major.minor.patch`) with optional `.postN` suffix
- Creates or updates a draft GitHub release
- Publishes the draft via [`softprops/action-gh-release`](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release)
